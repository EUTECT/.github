## Innovative Technologies

### + Sensitive Wire Feeder (SWF)
The world’s only patented force- and displacement-controlled solder wire feeder.  
SWF integrates advanced sensor technology to enable fully controlled, kink-free wire feeding with complete process traceability. This results in reduced solder consumption, lower maintenance effort, and highly repeatable solder joints.

### + Sustained Ring Soldering (SRS)
A fully automated system that forms precise solder rings directly from standard solder wire. These rings are placed around through-hole pins and soldered in an optimized cycle. SRS enables extremely consistent solder joints while utilizing nearly 100% of the solder material, significantly reducing waste.

### + Laser Galvo Soldering
High-precision laser soldering systems using agile galvo scanners for ultra-fast and accurate beam guidance. The process applies minimal thermal stress, protecting sensitive components. Integrated sensors and vision systems provide closed-loop control and full traceability for every solder joint.

### + Robotic Automation (MPC & EMI)
Our Multiple Process Changer (MPC) platform enables flexible integration of collaborative robots with various soldering tools. Using the EUTECT Machine Interface (EMI), operators can program and adapt processes via intuitive teach-in methods. This allows rapid setup of fully automated soldering cells, including advanced tool handling and process automation tailored to customer-specific requirements.

## Sustainability & Quality Assurance

Sustainability is a core part of EUTECT’s engineering philosophy. Our systems are designed for long service life, high energy efficiency, and minimal material waste. Modular designs reduce maintenance requirements and support reuse of components wherever possible.

Integrated sensors, monitoring systems, and software-based documentation ensure stable processes and complete traceability. Every critical parameter is recorded to guarantee consistent quality and compliance with the highest industry standards.

## Why EUTECT Stands Out

Driven by continuous research and development, EUTECT has established itself as a technology leader in electronics assembly. Our strength lies in deep process understanding and uncompromising customization. We do not adapt products to machines — we design machines around products.

From pioneering force-controlled solder wire feeding to fully robotic soldering cells with autonomous process handling, our innovations set new benchmarks for reliability, sustainability, and performance.
